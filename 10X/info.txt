DGE
---

This folder contains processed gene expression matrices for each sample
(*.dge.txt.gz) and for all samples combined (all.dge.txt.gz). These
expression matrices are generated from the "filtered_gene_bc_matrices"
folders in the CellRanger output. The matrices are filtered to remove
cells with fewer than 500 expressed genes. Within these matrices, each
row is a gene, each column is a cell barcode, and each value is a UMI
count. For convenience, the sample name is prepended to the cell barcode.
